# 🏏 Cricket Scoreboard Project – C Program

This repository contains a **Cricket Scoreboard System** built using the C programming language. The project simulates a digital cricket scoreboard where users can enter runs, wickets, overs, and view the updated match details. It is perfect for beginners, students, and anyone learning how to create menu-driven C programs.

## 📘 Introduction

Cricket scoreboards help track match progress by recording runs, wickets, and overs. This project replicates a simple version of that scoreboard. The program allows the user to update match details and automatically calculates important metrics like run rate.

The project demonstrates:
- Menu-driven design  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- Formatted output  
- Basic math operations  
- Clean and structured C programming  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a working cricket scoreboard using C  
- Allow users to update match details dynamically  
- Display real-time scoreboard updates  
- Automatically compute total score and run rate  
- Provide a final match summary  
- Strengthen understanding of core C concepts  

---

## ✨ Features

- Input **Team Name**  
- Set **Total Overs**  
- Add and update:  
  - Runs  
  - Wickets  
  - Overs  
- Automatic run rate calculation  
- Live scoreboard preview  
- Menu-driven user interface  
- Final match summary output

## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. The program starts by asking the user for the team name and total overs.  
2. A menu is shown with options to:
   - Add runs  
   - Add wickets  
   - Update overs  
   - Display scoreboard  
   - Exit  
3. Every time the user enters data, the scoreboard updates.  
4. When the user exits, a complete match summary is displayed.
